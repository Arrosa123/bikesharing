## Project Overview:

The purpose of this project was to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, which can use to impress potential investors. With analysis, figure out which month is best time of the year to rent a bike and how many rides could expect in the city of Des Moines. This will help investors get a ballpark estimate of how many bikes might need in Des Moines and decide to find the top locations for starting a bike journey among Citi Bike customers. 

## Results:

In this visualization, created the symbol map to measures the geographic location of the bike rental starting points. The box with the legend represent the dots, the smaller dot represent count of lower loction point and big dot represent the higher laoction of starting point. 

- Top Ending Loctions

In this visualization, created the symbol map to measures the geographic location of the bike rental ending points. The box with the legend represent the dots, the smaller dot represent count of lower loction point and big dot represent the higher laoction of ending points where people drop of the bikes.

## Summary:

From the analysis, the males were a major consumer of the bike sharing service rather than females. Also the service was a popular hit for workers as the usage correlated with the opening and closing hours of the work. With the symbol map, it was easier to know that the starting and ending loctions of customers using bikes. It will be helpful for anyone who wants to open bussiness of bike services in NYC.
