## Project Overview:

The purpose of this project was to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, which can use to impress potential investors. With analysis, figure out which month is best time of the year to rent a bike and how many rides could expect in the city of Des Moines. This will help investors get a ballpark estimate of how many bikes might need in Des Moines and decide to find the top locations for starting a bike journey among Citi Bike customers.
